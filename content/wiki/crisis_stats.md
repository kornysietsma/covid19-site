There is masses of info out there - I'm just listing some of the more useful places for regular stats:

* [ArcGis site with data from John Hopkins university](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) for data on a global map

* [Our world in Data site](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) - very long and detailed

* [Worldometer global info page](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) - country breakdowns

* [Information is Beautiful page](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/) - not I've had friends criticise this for some editorialising - comments which don't reflect the data (this was a while ago, they may have improved)

* [Don't Panic - Ars Tecnica in-depth coronavirus page](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/dont-panic-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-guide-to-the-coronavirus/)
