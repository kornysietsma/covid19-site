I thought it was worth calling out the main reputable sources of information - it's easy to read cool summary articles and sites, but _we should also be careful about people who sound definitive but are just another person online_.

Of course, just because these people are more trustworthy sources, doesn't make them agenda-less, and they might just get stuff wrong!
