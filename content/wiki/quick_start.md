Good places to start:

* [Parenting](/category/parenting) for resources for parents
* [Blog](/category/blog) for updates, changes, and occasional reflections or things that don't go anywhere else
* [Info](/category/info) for information resources - stats, research, dumps
* [Work](/category/work) for information about working in this new world
* [Health](/category/health) for information about healthcare specifically - ways to stay healthy, ways to look after yourself, mental health...
* [Play](/category/play) for ways to have fun, de-stress, relax. (kid-specific stuff might be under parenting)
* [the distance_learning tag](/tag/distance_learning) for people, mostly kids, trying to learn at home.  This used to be "home schooling" but as it says in the [post I copied about distance learning](/-/-/diary/2020-03-21-distance-learning-q-and-a/) it's really not.
* [the remote_work tag](/tag/remote_work) for remote working ideas
* [The firehose](/firehose/-/-) for all my uncategorised links!
