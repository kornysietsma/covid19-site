This is just a site I threw together quickly to collect and share useful resources related to covid-19 aka CoronaVirus.  

The source code and content is at <https://github.com/kornysietsma/covid19-site>

Information is here in three rough styles:

- Diary pages, which are date-based pages and are listed chronologically
- Wiki pages, which are general-purpose information pages and are listed alphabetically
- Firehose lists, which are lists of bookmarks and stuff I haven't sorted yet, and are listed chronologically if you click "firehose mode" - there probably won't be much of this on this site.

I'm happy to receive suggested changes, either by email or (for techy folks) pull requests!  All the content is markdown or JSON, the file formats should be pretty self evident.

The CSS is pretty minimal - it's sort of responsive, but not very pretty.

See my blog post at <https://blog.korny.info/2020/03/19/gatsby-digital-garden.html> for more about how this kind of site works!
