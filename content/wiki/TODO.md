There's a lot to do here!

If you see something you'd like me to fix, the best way is probably to [create an issue on the github site](https://github.com/kornysietsma/covid19-site/issues) - though this is a volunteer effort from a busy parent so no guarantees I'll react quickly!

# Site to-dos

## Mobile support

* show/hide toggles for Navigation panel
* work out how to display meta information right
* maybe needs a whole mobile-first rethinking?  Though my primary user is me, and I like to browse on my laptop

# Content to-dos

* categorise a lot of the firehose!

# Other

* is the default MIT license OK?
