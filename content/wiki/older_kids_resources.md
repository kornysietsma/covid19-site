This is useful stuff I've found for older kids, but too old for our 3-year-old!

# Virus explainers

quite a few "explain the virus to my kids" options:

* https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-kids-guide.html
* [CovidBook](https://www.mindheart.co/descargables)

# Podcasts

* [Imagine This](https://www.abc.net.au/kidslisten/imagine-this/) ABC (Aus) kids show for 4 and up
