**NOTE** There seems to be a fair bit of confusion about whether people are allowed to visit green spaces in their cars.  Many police groups seem to be saying "No" - some goverment and other people seem to be saying "within reasonable distances" with no indication of what that means.

I suspect that means probably best not to, unless you live somewhere fairly quiet and are going somewhere really quiet.  Remember you want a 2m distance - that's not compatible with running around crowded parks!

But also, even if you aren't allowed to drive, there may be places here you can walk, or cycle to.  Or visit once this has all blown over.
