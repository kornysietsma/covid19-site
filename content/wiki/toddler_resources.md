Trying to categorise stuff for younger kids - I have a 3-year-old, and no matter how brilliant I think they are, they aren't going to be exploring digital museums any time soon.

Note: _(this page is a work in progress!!!)_

## Education

### Offline (at least in part)

All in one HomeSchool has a printable curriculum at [Getting Ready 1](https://allinonehomeschool.com/getting-ready-1/) for 4 year olds - though most of their curriculum needs web access e.g. youtube songs.

[The Imagination Tree](https://theimaginationtree.com/) has a [neat stay-at-home survival guide](https://theimaginationtree.com/stay-at-home-survival-guide/) and lots of other ideas.  Some free, some paid - ideas like play materials to stock up on.

[Oxford Owl at Home](https://home.oxfordowl.co.uk/) has lots of learning stuff [including a 3-4 year age group](https://home.oxfordowl.co.uk/help-child-learn-age-3-4/) - this is from OUP! Some downloadable, some for purchase

#### Nature and wildlife

The [Woodland Trust](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/) had a blog at https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2020/03/nature-detectives/ which now points to a bunch of other things:

[10 nature activities you can do at home for kids](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2020/03/kids-nature-activities-self-isolation/)

[5 nature activities for adults](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2020/04/self-isolation-home-nature-activities/)
