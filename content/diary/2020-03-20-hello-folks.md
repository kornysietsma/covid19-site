Hi folks who've found this site.

These are difficult times.  As a parent, and a privileged IT worker, I've been swamped with information, both alarming and useful.

Recently a work chat group provided a whole pile of useful parenting links, and I thought it'd be easier for me to categorise them using the tools I already have to hand, and put them up on a website, rather than sharing them piecemeal with other parents.

And so this site was born!  It'll stay pretty ad-hoc for now, but I'll try to grow it as I find time - between work, and isolation, and dealing with a lovely 3-year-old whose childminder has gone into isolation, and who doesn't understand why he can't go to soft play... it's going to be tough.

I'll start with parenting stuff, but add other bits as I find them useful - it's helpful for me as well to categorise stuff I'm bookmarking.

About me - I'm Kornelis AKA Korny, I live in Leighton Buzzard, England, with my lovely wife Becky and our son Rowan.

A week ago I came down with a cough - well, I'd had a cough already but it got worse - so we thought it was sensible to go into isolation.  The cough is mostly better, but still hanging around - none of my family have any significant symptoms though, so hopefully either I got a really minor case, or I didn't get the virus.  Either way we are going to play it very safe.

Anyway, this wasn't meant to be replacing my blog! Just thought I'd get an introductory note in while I'm setting everything up.
