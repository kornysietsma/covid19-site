Many police groups seem to be saying \"No\" - some goverment and other people seem to be saying \"within reasonable distances\" with no indication of what that means.</p>\n<p>I suspect that means probably best not to, unless you live somewhere fairly quiet and are going somewhere really quiet.  Remember you want a 2m distance - that's not compatible with running around crowded parks!</p>\n<p>But also, even if you aren't allowed to drive, there may be places here you can walk, or cycle to.  Or visit once this has all blown over.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/27/police-acknowledge-confusion-over-uk-lockdown-rules\">This is a Guardian article over confusion in regard to the current rules</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"search-sites-for-green-spaces\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#search-sites-for-green-spaces\" aria-label=\"search sites for green spaces permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Search sites for green spaces:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/woods#=undefined&#x26;view=map\">Woodland Trust map search</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/find-a-walk-or-route.aspx\">Ramblers walk search</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/nature-reserves\">Wildlife Trusts search</a> - note the various wildlife trusts are semi-independant so you might want to search the one nearest you</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.forestryengland.uk/visit\">Forestry England - find a forest</a></li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#search-sites-for-green-spaces\">Search sites for green spaces:</a></li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"kind":"markdown","slug":"/wiki/green_spaces_uk/","title":"Green spaces for exploring in the UK","tags":["mental_health","exercise","play","nature","UK","walking"],"category":"play","date":"2020-03-27T18:47:18.928Z","selectedTag":null,"selectedCategory":"play"}}}
